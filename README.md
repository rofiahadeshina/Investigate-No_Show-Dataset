## by Rofiah Adeshina


## Dataset


The dataset we are using for this analysis contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil.
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. This investigation is centered on discovering the reasons why this might happen.
Are they factors that cause patients not to show up? If so what are these factors and how do they vary in patients that do show up and those that don't


## Summary of Findings

The analysis was focused on determining the reasons why patients missed their scheduled appointments.
We examined 6 features including 1 engineered feature (Age, Gender, Alcolism, Diabeted, Hipertension, Time ) to deduce a conclusion on our analysis.

We considered how each feature affects this characteristics (No-show) and were able to come to the following conclusions:

* Generally more Patients (80% of the population) show up to their appointments.
* Age does not determine if people show up to their appointments or not as there is no significant difference in the average ages of those who showed up and those that didn't.
* There is a higher chance that the patient will show up if they are female as they account for 65% of the entire population and 80% of them show up to their appointments
* Most Diabetic and hipertensive patients show up to their appointments
* Time (wait period) determines if patients show-up or not as people longer wait period between appointments day and scheduled day deter patients from going to their appointments
